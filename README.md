## Dataset Files

- `train.csv`: Training set containing information about a subset of passengers, including whether they survived or not.
- `test.csv`: Test set with similar information but without the "Survived" column.

## Columns

1. **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
2. **Survived**: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
3. **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
4. **Name**: Passenger's name.
5. **Sex**: Passenger's gender.
6. **Age**: Passenger's age.
7. **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
